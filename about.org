title: About
---

I’m a 19-year-old programmer studying Business Informatics at NUST MISIS in Moscow.
Right now, I’m trying to find a job and do what I love for a living.
I’ve done quite a bit of backend development, a bit of systems programming, and built a small Lisp compiler.
These days, I’m learning math and ML, and I also play around with Lean.
In the future, I’d like to work in research or something related to high-frequency trading.
I plan to post more about my projects and interesting things I discover along the way.
